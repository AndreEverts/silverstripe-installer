To upgrade your installation of SilverStripe, simply copy the
sapphire, cms & jsparty folders overtop of your existing installation.
Then flush the cache and rebuild the database (db/build?flush=1).

If there are any special notes on upgrading to a particular version,
these will be documented here.
